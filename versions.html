        <h4>1.21 (Tricky Trials)</h4>
        <p>The Tricky Trials update added many new features to the game, such as various new blocks, a new structure, and a few new mobs.</p>
        <p>The Trail Chambers are a new structure that can be found underground in Minecraft. They mainly consist of several large rooms made out of tuff and copper blocks. They are also home to the new mob: the Breeze. The Breeze is the counterpart to the Blaze. Breezes drops Breeze Rods, similarly to how Blazes drop Blaze Rods. </p>
